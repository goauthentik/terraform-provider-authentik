# Terraform Provider authentik

Tested against authentik main and stable, on terraform 1.2.1

Run the following command to build the provider

```shell
make build
```

### Generate Documentation

Run `make` from the project root to regenerate the latest provider documentation

## Run tests using a Dev Container

Running the included Dev Container will create a full authentik development environment automatically as if following the instructions found here: https://goauthentik.io/docs/installation/docker-compose

Once the Dev Container is running, simply use the VS Code Command Palette or Test UI to run any tests as needed.

Note: If running all tests, this is very CPU-intensive on your local authentik environment, so depending on your hardware they can take several minutes to complete.

## Run tests using a local environment

Start a local authentik instance by following https://goauthentik.io/docs/installation/docker-compose

Before starting the instance, add this static token to the `.env` file:

```
AUTHENTIK_TOKEN=this-token-is-for-testing-dont-use
```

Afterwards, tests can be run from VS Code with the Command Palette or Test UI, or via CLI like so:

```
export AUTHENTIK_URL=http://localhost:9000
export AUTHENTIK_TOKEN=this-token-is-for-testing-dont-use
make test
```

If you're trying to run tests with VS Code in your local environment, be sure to change `AUTHENTIK_URL` in `.vscode/settings.json` to: `"AUTHENTIK_URL": "http://localhost:9000"`

Note: If running all tests, this is very CPU-intensive on your local authentik environment, so depending on your hardware they can take several minutes to complete.

## Versioning

This provider's version is based on the authentik version it's tested against.
